Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

  -	I added a getNumOfEdges() method to my Graph class to make it easy
  	for the client to see how many edges are currently in the graph.  In
  	order for this to work, I created a new private variable that increases
  	each time addEdge() is called.
  - In my GraphNode class, I had to change my equals method so that it
  	properly overrode the equals method.  This way all methods are able to use
  	it properly.
  -	Added an overridden hashCode() method to complement the equals method() so that
    the nodes and edges can be properly stored in a HashSet or HashMap.
  - Added a getNode() method to my graph class so that I could access specific nodes
  	by just using the data in the node.
  - Made node and edge implement comparable so that they can be inserted into TreeSets
  	and TreeMaps.  This way they can be alphabetically sorted.
  - Changed Graph and GraphNode so that the children of each node is stored into a HashMap
  	in the actual graph class.  By changing this, the GraphNode no longer holds its children
  	but only its data.
  - Changed the parameters of addEdge in graph to take in two strings rather than two graphNodes
  	so this way a new graphNode does not have to be created each time it is called.
  - Had to update the listChildren method in the SpecificationTests because it erased nodes when
    there were multiple children with different edge datas.
  - Got rid of getChildren in edge, addChild, and the list of its children.  A getChildren method
  	was then added to the Graph class because that is what holds all the children of each node in
  	the graph.
