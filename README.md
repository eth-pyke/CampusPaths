# Campus Paths

Campus Paths is an Android application that allows a user to find the shortest geographical pathway between all the buildings on the University of Washington's campus. This application used weighted graphs to find the shortest distance between every location. This application is much more detailed than other options such as Google Maps or Apple Maps as it provides several different locations that the alternatives do not have. Additionally, it takes advantage of more paths that the alternatives do not.
